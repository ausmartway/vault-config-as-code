# HCP specific details

This branch contains code for a HCP development cluster that does not have Sentinel function.

The cluster can be accessed from the following URL: https://vault-cluster-public-vault-bb7b95a8.c950b5f7.z1.hashicorp.cloud:8200, namespace:admin

Anyone from GitHub.com HashiCorp organization can authenticate with the cluster using their GitHub personal token, with the "default" policy.

If you want to see more, you can onboard yourself by creating a human identity in the identities folder, then add yourself to the ANZ SEA group in the identity_groups folder.

I will approve your PR when free, you can also ping me on Slack.
